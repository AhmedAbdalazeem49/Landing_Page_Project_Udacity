## What I have learned in this project:
* ### Creating **Function** to control the elements in *Html Files* like [index.html file](index.html).
* ### Crating **Functions** to control the style in *Css Files* like [style.ccs file](css/styles.css)
* ### Getting Elements with new methods like **getElementByTagName** *and* **querySelector** to control these *content* **and** *properites*.
* ### learning how to make **Arrow Functions** and **addEventListener** *Functions*.

## What I have used : 

1. ### First:
  * #### I have get element from [index.html](index.html) using **querySelectorAll()** **,** **getElementById()** *And* **getElementByTagName** *Methods*.
  * ### then **Storing** them in a *Variable* to access them *faster* and deal them *easier*.
2. ### Second:
  * #### I declared **Function** to **Loop on Sections** *and* **generate List Item for each section**.
  * #### then I have added these list items to **Nav Menu** In **Body**.
3. ### Third:
  * #### Add Styling which relatd to **Your-active-class** Class to the **Active Section**.
  * #### **Change** the Section when *Scrolling*.
  * #### **Add** the *Active Class* Only to section you **Stands On**.
  * #### Remove the **Your-active-class** Class from All the *Rest Sections*.
4. ### Fourth:
  * #### I have Made an **Arrow Function** to :
      * ### To make the page *Scroll* to the *Section* Clicked on the *List Item* From the **Nav Menu** Which has the **Same ID**.
  * #### the movement should be done **Smoothly**.

### My Files and Methods:
* #### I have connect the [app.js file](js/app.js) with [index.html file](index.html) as I have write the connection code before the **Body Close Tag** In [index.html file](index.html).
* ### Then I have added two more *Section* to [index.html file](index.html) **As Required**.
* ### Create function to loop on Sections and create **List Items** And add them to **Nav Menu**.
* ### Add an *addEventlistener* **Function** to keep us on track and move us to the *Right Section* Choosen.
* ### All the functions have been declared in [app.js file](js/app.js).
